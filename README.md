# JoomBlank (Bootstrap Version)
Template to use where you need to create a new Joomla Template without stress (And with many features). Based/inspired on Bloggerschmidt/Blank repository.

# My Motivation
I always used the [Bloggerschmidt's repository](https://github.com/Bloggerschmidt/Blank) when i'm developing a website template.
There i could find everything I needed, but I also noticed that there were a lot of things I'd like to change, including more automated use of template (including some CDNs).

# Features Used
- jQuery 3.3.1 (Slim)
- Bootstrap 4.3.1
- FontAwesome 5.8.1
